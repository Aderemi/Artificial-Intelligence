# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial intelligence source codes; ranges from search algorithms to  learning algorithm to neural network. Artificial intelligence cuts across many fields, philosophy, sociology, psychology, statistics, economics, computer engineering, computer science and others, and the trend is requiring different implementation of problem solvers for all fields to properly assimilate what the field of Artificial Intelligence is trying to do and how it is doing it. There are [] sources in this repo
1. search_algo.py
This file contains code implement three search alogrithms namely
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- A Star

In solving 8-Puzzle game... Insteading of common way of declaring multi-dimensional array, this implements single-dimensional array which gives it super fast abilities. 

# HOW TO USE

python search_algo.py SEARCH_METHOD[BFS, DFS, AST] problem_string
example python BFS 1,3,0,2,4,6,5,8,7
